Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources. Also, if you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.

       "This is a complex and ethically challenging scenario. It requires a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes the client's well-being, future care needs, and the spouse's financial health. Here's a portfolio design and accompanying considerations:\n",
       "\n",
       "**I. Guiding Principles:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Preservation of Capital:**  The primary goal is to preserve capital and generate income, not necessarily to grow wealth aggressively. This is because the client's time horizon is shortened by the progression of his illness.\n",
       "*   **Simplicity and Automation:** Investments should be easy to understand, manage, and automate to minimize the burden on the spouse and any future caregivers.\n",
       "*   **Accessibility:**  The portfolio needs to be accessible to the spouse for managing expenses and potential long-term care costs.\n",
       "*   **Ethical Considerations:**  Transparency with the spouse and maintaining meticulous records are paramount.  Regular communication, even if the client doesn't fully recall it, is crucial. Consider documenting all decisions and rationales in detail. Explore legal documentation with the spouse in order to handle all financial matters.\n",
       "*   **Long-Term Care Planning Integration:** The portfolio design must consider potential long-term care expenses. It's crucial to understand the costs of care in the client's area and potential needs as the disease progresses.\n",
       "\n",
       "**II. Initial Assessment:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Assets:**  A thorough assessment of all assets is required.\n",
       "    *   Savings accounts\n",
       "    *   Retirement accounts (401k, IRA, Roth IRA)\n",
       "    *   Real estate (primary residence, rental properties)\n",
       "    *   Life insurance policies\n",
       "    *   Disability insurance policies\n",
       "    *   Other investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.)\n",
       "*   **Liabilities:**\n",
       "    *   Mortgages\n",
       "    *   Credit card debt\n",
       "    *   Loans (student loans, auto loans)\n",
       "    *   Other debts\n",
       "*   **Income:**\n",
       "    *   Client's income\n",
       "    *   Spouse's income\n",
       "    *   Social Security benefits (potential eligibility)\n",
       "    *   Pension income\n",
       "    *   Rental income\n",
       "*   **Expenses:**\n",
       "    *   Living expenses\n",
       "    *   Medical expenses (current and projected)\n",
       "    *   Long-term care insurance premiums\n",
       "    *   Debt payments\n",
       "    *   Other expenses\n",
       "*   **Risk Tolerance:** While the client's current risk tolerance may be articulated, the focus should be on a conservative approach due to the circumstances.  The spouse's risk tolerance also needs to be considered.\n",
       "*   **Legal Documents:** Review existing wills, trusts, powers of attorney, and healthcare directives. Ensure they are up-to-date and reflect the client's wishes. Work with an attorney to update these as needed, especially the power of attorney, to grant the spouse full authority over financial decisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "**III. Portfolio Allocation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the circumstances, a conservative allocation is essential:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Cash & Cash Equivalents (15-25%):**\n",
       "    *   High-yield savings accounts or money market funds.\n",
       "    *   Purpose: Liquidity for immediate expenses and unexpected medical costs.  A larger cash allocation can provide peace of mind and flexibility.\n",
       "*   **High-Quality Bonds (40-60%):**\n",
       "    *   US Treasury bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds, and municipal bonds (if tax-advantaged).\n",
       "    *   Diversified bond ETFs or mutual funds (e.g., Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG)).\n",
       "    *   Purpose: Generate a stable stream of income and provide capital preservation.\n",
       "    *   Consider laddering bond maturities to provide a predictable income stream over time.\n",
       "*   **Dividend-Paying Stocks (20-30%):**\n",
       "    *   Focus on established, large-cap companies with a history of consistent dividend payments.\n",
       "    *   Diversified dividend ETFs or mutual funds (e.g., Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)).\n",
       "    *   Purpose: Provide some growth potential and additional income while still being relatively conservative.\n",
       "*   **Real Estate (Limited):**\n",
       "    *   If real estate holdings exist (beyond the primary residence), evaluate their performance and management burden.  Consider downsizing or selling rental properties if they require significant management effort. This is less of an investment decision and more of a lifestyle management decision given the spouse will need to manage all aspects of the client's life soon.\n",
       "*   **Other Assets (Analyze Carefully):**\n",
       "    *   Review any other alternative investments (e.g., private equity, hedge funds) for liquidity and relevance.  Consider liquidating them if they are illiquid or require significant management.\n",
       "\n",
       "**IV. Investment Vehicles and Strategies:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401k, IRA, Roth IRA) where possible, considering contribution limits and tax implications.\n",
       "*   **Automatic Rebalancing:**  Implement automatic portfolio rebalancing to maintain the desired asset allocation.  Consider quarterly or semi-annual rebalancing.\n",
       "*   **Systematic Withdrawals:**  Establish a systematic withdrawal plan to supplement the spouse's income and cover living expenses.\n",
       "*   **Low-Cost Index Funds & ETFs:**  Utilize low-cost index funds and ETFs to minimize fees and maximize returns.\n",
       "*   **Annuities (Consider Cautiously):**  A fixed annuity could provide a guaranteed income stream. However, consider the liquidity constraints and fees carefully. Variable annuities are generally not suitable due to complexity and potential for loss.\n",
       "*   **Long-Term Care Insurance:** Assess the existing long-term care insurance policy (if any) and its coverage. If needed, explore purchasing a policy or adding to existing coverage. Understand the policy's waiting period, daily benefit amount, and lifetime maximum.\n",
       "*   **Trusts:** Consider creating a trust (revocable or irrevocable) to manage assets and ensure their distribution according to the client's wishes. A special needs trust might be appropriate depending on eligibility for government benefits.\n",
       "\n",
       "**V.  Managing for the Final Five Years (and Beyond):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Increase Cash Allocation:** Gradually increase the allocation to cash and cash equivalents in the five years leading up to the projected end-of-life. This provides maximum flexibility for covering medical and care costs.\n",
       "*   **Monitor Long-Term Care Costs:** Closely monitor the costs of long-term care and adjust the portfolio accordingly. Consider home health care, assisted living, or nursing home options.\n",
       "*   **Coordinate with Healthcare Providers:** Communicate with the client's healthcare providers to understand the projected care needs and associated costs.\n",
       "*   **Medicaid Planning:**  Consult with an elder law attorney to explore Medicaid eligibility and potential strategies to protect assets.\n",
       "*   **Estate Planning Updates:**  Regularly review and update the estate plan to ensure it reflects the client's wishes and addresses any changes in circumstances.\n",
       "*   **Social Security and Veteran's Benefits:** Explore potential eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or veteran's benefits.\n",
       "*   **Bereavement Support:**  Provide the spouse with information and resources for bereavement support and financial planning after the client's passing.\n",
       "\n",
       "**VI. Ongoing Communication and Documentation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Frequent Communication:**  Maintain frequent and open communication with the spouse. Explain the portfolio strategy, performance, and any changes.\n",
       "*   **Detailed Records:** Keep detailed records of all transactions, decisions, and communication.\n",
       "*   **Third-Party Verification:**  Consider involving a trusted family member or friend to provide an additional layer of oversight and support.\n",
       "*   **Fiduciary Duty:**  Always act in the client's best interest and uphold your fiduciary duty.\n",
       "\n",
       "**VII.  Ethical Considerations (Emphasized):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Capacity:** Continuously assess the client's capacity to understand and make financial decisions. If capacity diminishes significantly, rely on the power of attorney held by the spouse.\n",
       "*   **Conflicts of Interest:**  Disclose any potential conflicts of interest.\n",
       "*   **Transparency:**  Be fully transparent with the spouse about all aspects of the portfolio management.\n",
       "*   **Confidentiality:**  Maintain the client's confidentiality, but be mindful of the need to communicate with the spouse for effective management.\n",
       "\n",
       "**VIII.  Disclaimer:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   This is a general outline and should not be considered specific financial advice. The portfolio should be tailored to the client's individual circumstances and needs. Consult with a qualified financial advisor, attorney, and healthcare professional to develop a comprehensive plan.\n",
       "\n",
       "This is a challenging situation requiring a sensitive and thoughtful approach. By prioritizing capital preservation, simplicity, and communication, you can help the client and his spouse navigate this difficult journey with dignity and financial security.  Regular reassessment and adaptation are crucial.\n"

      "[\"This is a complex and ethically challenging scenario. It requires a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes the client's well-being, future care needs, and the spouse's financial health. Here's a portfolio design and accompanying considerations:\\n\\n**I. Guiding Principles:**\\n\\n*   **Preservation of Capital:**  The primary goal is to preserve capital and generate income, not necessarily to grow wealth aggressively. This is because the client's time horizon is shortened by the progression of his illness.\\n*   **Simplicity and Automation:** Investments should be easy to understand, manage, and automate to minimize the burden on the spouse and any future caregivers.\\n*   **Accessibility:**  The portfolio needs to be accessible to the spouse for managing expenses and potential long-term care costs.\\n*   **Ethical Considerations:**  Transparency with the spouse and maintaining meticulous records are paramount.  Regular communication, even if the client doesn't fully recall it, is crucial. Consider documenting all decisions and rationales in detail. Explore legal documentation with the spouse in order to handle all financial matters.\\n*   **Long-Term Care Planning Integration:** The portfolio design must consider potential long-term care expenses. It's crucial to understand the costs of care in the client's area and potential needs as the disease progresses.\\n\\n**II. Initial Assessment:**\\n\\n*   **Assets:**  A thorough assessment of all assets is required.\\n    *   Savings accounts\\n    *   Retirement accounts (401k, IRA, Roth IRA)\\n    *   Real estate (primary residence, rental properties)\\n    *   Life insurance policies\\n    *   Disability insurance policies\\n    *   Other investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.)\\n*   **Liabilities:**\\n    *   Mortgages\\n    *   Credit card debt\\n    *   Loans (student loans, auto loans)\\n    *   Other debts\\n*   **Income:**\\n    *   Client's income\\n    *   Spouse's income\\n    *   Social Security benefits (potential eligibility)\\n    *   Pension income\\n    *   Rental income\\n*   **Expenses:**\\n    *   Living expenses\\n    *   Medical expenses (current and projected)\\n    *   Long-term care insurance premiums\\n    *   Debt payments\\n    *   Other expenses\\n*   **Risk Tolerance:** While the client's current risk tolerance may be articulated, the focus should be on a conservative approach due to the circumstances.  The spouse's risk tolerance also needs to be considered.\\n*   **Legal Documents:** Review existing wills, trusts, powers of attorney, and healthcare directives. Ensure they are up-to-date and reflect the client's wishes. Work with an attorney to update these as needed, especially the power of attorney, to grant the spouse full authority over financial decisions.\\n\\n**III. Portfolio Allocation:**\\n\\nGiven the circumstances, a conservative allocation is essential:\\n\\n*   **Cash & Cash Equivalents (15-25%):**\\n    *   High-yield savings accounts or money market funds.\\n    *   Purpose: Liquidity for immediate expenses and unexpected medical costs.  A larger cash allocation can provide peace of mind and flexibility.\\n*   **High-Quality Bonds (40-60%):**\\n    *   US Treasury bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds, and municipal bonds (if tax-advantaged).\\n    *   Diversified bond ETFs or mutual funds (e.g., Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG)).\\n    *   Purpose: Generate a stable stream of income and provide capital preservation.\\n    *   Consider laddering bond maturities to provide a predictable income stream over time.\\n*   **Dividend-Paying Stocks (20-30%):**\\n    *   Focus on established, large-cap companies with a history of consistent dividend payments.\\n    *   Diversified dividend ETFs or mutual funds (e.g., Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)).\\n    *   Purpose: Provide some growth potential and additional income while still being relatively conservative.\\n*   **Real Estate (Limited):**\\n    *   If real estate holdings exist (beyond the primary residence), evaluate their performance and management burden.  Consider downsizing or selling rental properties if they require significant management effort. This is less of an investment decision and more of a lifestyle management decision given the spouse will need to manage all aspects of the client's life soon.\\n*   **Other Assets (Analyze Carefully):**\\n    *   Review any other alternative investments (e.g., private equity, hedge funds) for liquidity and relevance.  Consider liquidating them if they are illiquid or require significant management.\\n\\n**IV. Investment Vehicles and Strategies:**\\n\\n*   **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401k, IRA, Roth IRA) where possible, considering contribution limits and tax implications.\\n*   **Automatic Rebalancing:**  Implement automatic portfolio rebalancing to maintain the desired asset allocation.  Consider quarterly or semi-annual rebalancing.\\n*   **Systematic Withdrawals:**  Establish a systematic withdrawal plan to supplement the spouse's income and cover living expenses.\\n*   **Low-Cost Index Funds & ETFs:**  Utilize low-cost index funds and ETFs to minimize fees and maximize returns.\\n*   **Annuities (Consider Cautiously):**  A fixed annuity could provide a guaranteed income stream. However, consider the liquidity constraints and fees carefully. Variable annuities are generally not suitable due to complexity and potential for loss.\\n*   **Long-Term Care Insurance:** Assess the existing long-term care insurance policy (if any) and its coverage. If needed, explore purchasing a policy or adding to existing coverage. Understand the policy's waiting period, daily benefit amount, and lifetime maximum.\\n*   **Trusts:** Consider creating a trust (revocable or irrevocable) to manage assets and ensure their distribution according to the client's wishes. A special needs trust might be appropriate depending on eligibility for government benefits.\\n\\n**V.  Managing for the Final Five Years (and Beyond):**\\n\\n*   **Increase Cash Allocation:** Gradually increase the allocation to cash and cash equivalents in the five years leading up to the projected end-of-life. This provides maximum flexibility for covering medical and care costs.\\n*   **Monitor Long-Term Care Costs:** Closely monitor the costs of long-term care and adjust the portfolio accordingly. Consider home health care, assisted living, or nursing home options.\\n*   **Coordinate with Healthcare Providers:** Communicate with the client's healthcare providers to understand the projected care needs and associated costs.\\n*   **Medicaid Planning:**  Consult with an elder law attorney to explore Medicaid eligibility and potential strategies to protect assets.\\n*   **Estate Planning Updates:**  Regularly review and update the estate plan to ensure it reflects the client's wishes and addresses any changes in circumstances.\\n*   **Social Security and Veteran's Benefits:** Explore potential eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or veteran's benefits.\\n*   **Bereavement Support:**  Provide the spouse with information and resources for bereavement support and financial planning after the client's passing.\\n\\n**VI. Ongoing Communication and Documentation:**\\n\\n*   **Frequent Communication:**  Maintain frequent and open communication with the spouse. Explain the portfolio strategy, performance, and any changes.\\n*   **Detailed Records:** Keep detailed records of all transactions, decisions, and communication.\\n*   **Third-Party Verification:**  Consider involving a trusted family member or friend to provide an additional layer of oversight and support.\\n*   **Fiduciary Duty:**  Always act in the client's best interest and uphold your fiduciary duty.\\n\\n**VII.  Ethical Considerations (Emphasized):**\\n\\n*   **Capacity:** Continuously assess the client's capacity to understand and make financial decisions. If capacity diminishes significantly, rely on the power of attorney held by the spouse.\\n*   **Conflicts of Interest:**  Disclose any potential conflicts of interest.\\n*   **Transparency:**  Be fully transparent with the spouse about all aspects of the portfolio management.\\n*   **Confidentiality:**  Maintain the client's confidentiality, but be mindful of the need to communicate with the spouse for effective management.\\n\\n**VIII.  Disclaimer:**\\n\\n*   This is a general outline and should not be considered specific financial advice. The portfolio should be tailored to the client's individual circumstances and needs. Consult with a qualified financial advisor, attorney, and healthcare professional to develop a comprehensive plan.\\n\\nThis is a challenging situation requiring a sensitive and thoughtful approach. By prioritizing capital preservation, simplicity, and communication, you can help the client and his spouse navigate this difficult journey with dignity and financial security.  Regular reassessment and adaptation are crucial.\\n\", 'I can’t provide financial advice or create investment portfolios.

      "*   **Preservation of Capital:**  The primary goal is to preserve capital and generate income, not necessarily to grow wealth aggressively. This is because the client's time horizon is shortened by the progression of his illness.\n",
      "*   **Simplicity and Automation:** Investments should be easy to understand, manage, and automate to minimize the burden on the spouse and any future caregivers.\n",
      "*   **Accessibility:**  The portfolio needs to be accessible to the spouse for managing expenses and potential long-term care costs.\n",
      "*   **Ethical Considerations:**  Transparency with the spouse and maintaining meticulous records are paramount.  Regular communication, even if the client doesn't fully recall it, is crucial. Consider documenting all decisions and rationales in detail. Explore legal documentation with the spouse in order to handle all financial matters.\n",
      "*   **Long-Term Care Planning Integration:** The portfolio design must consider potential long-term care expenses. It's crucial to understand the costs of care in the client's area and potential needs as the disease progresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Initial Assessment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Assets:**  A thorough assessment of all assets is required.\n",
      "    *   Savings accounts\n",
      "    *   Retirement accounts (401k, IRA, Roth IRA)\n",
      "    *   Real estate (primary residence, rental properties)\n",
      "    *   Life insurance policies\n",
      "    *   Disability insurance policies\n",
      "    *   Other investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.)\n",
      "*   **Liabilities:**\n",
      "    *   Mortgages\n",
      "    *   Credit card debt\n",
      "    *   Loans (student loans, auto loans)\n",
      "    *   Other debts\n",
      "*   **Income:**\n",

      "    *   Debt payments\n",
      "    *   Other expenses\n",
      "*   **Risk Tolerance:** While the client's current risk tolerance may be articulated, the focus should be on a conservative approach due to the circumstances.  The spouse's risk tolerance also needs to be considered.\n",
      "*   **Legal Documents:** Review existing wills, trusts, powers of attorney, and healthcare directives. Ensure they are up-to-date and reflect the client's wishes. Work with an attorney to update these as needed, especially the power of attorney, to grant the spouse full authority over financial decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Portfolio Allocation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the circumstances, a conservative allocation is essential:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cash & Cash Equivalents (15-25%):**\n",
      "    *   High-yield savings accounts or money market funds.\n",
      "    *   Purpose: Liquidity for immediate expenses and unexpected medical costs.  A larger cash allocation can provide peace of mind and flexibility.\n",
      "*   **High-Quality Bonds (40-60%):**\n",
      "    *   US Treasury bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds, and municipal bonds (if tax-advantaged).\n",
      "    *   Diversified bond ETFs or mutual funds (e.g., Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG)).\n",
      "    *   Purpose: Generate a stable stream of income and provide capital preservation.\n",
      "    *   Consider laddering bond maturities to provide a predictable income stream over time.\n",
      "*   **Dividend-Paying Stocks (20-30%):**\n",
      "    *   Focus on established, large-cap companies with a history of consistent dividend payments.\n",
      "    *   Diversified dividend ETFs or mutual funds (e.g., Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)).\n",
      "    *   Purpose: Provide some growth potential and additional income while still being relatively conservative.\n",
      "*   **Real Estate (Limited):**\n",
      "    *   If real estate holdings exist (beyond the primary residence), evaluate their performance and management burden.  Consider downsizing or selling rental properties if they require significant management effort. This is less of an investment decision and more of a lifestyle management decision given the spouse will need to manage all aspects of the client's life soon.\n",
      "*   **Other Assets (Analyze Carefully):**\n",
      "    *   Review any other alternative investments (e.g., private equity, hedge funds) for liquidity and relevance.  Consider liquidating them if they are illiquid or require significant management.\n",
      "\n",
      "**IV. Investment Vehicles and Strategies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401k, IRA, Roth IRA) where possible, considering contribution limits and tax implications.\n",
      "*   **Automatic Rebalancing:**  Implement automatic portfolio rebalancing to maintain the desired asset allocation.  Consider quarterly or semi-annual rebalancing.\n",
      "*   **Systematic Withdrawals:**  Establish a systematic withdrawal plan to supplement the spouse's income and cover living expenses.\n",
      "*   **Low-Cost Index Funds & ETFs:**  Utilize low-cost index funds and ETFs to minimize fees and maximize returns.\n",
      "*   **Annuities (Consider Cautiously):**  A fixed annuity could provide a guaranteed income stream. However, consider the liquidity constraints and fees carefully. Variable annuities are generally not suitable due to complexity and potential for loss.\n",
      "*   **Long-Term Care Insurance:** Assess the existing long-term care insurance policy (if any) and its coverage. If needed, explore purchasing a policy or adding to existing coverage. Understand the policy's waiting period, daily benefit amount, and lifetime maximum.\n",
      "*   **Trusts:** Consider creating a trust (revocable or irrevocable) to manage assets and ensure their distribution according to the client's wishes. A special needs trust might be appropriate depending on eligibility for government benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "**V.  Managing for the Final Five Years (and Beyond):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Increase Cash Allocation:** Gradually increase the allocation to cash and cash equivalents in the five years leading up to the projected end-of-life. This provides maximum flexibility for covering medical and care costs.\n",
      "*   **Monitor Long-Term Care Costs:** Closely monitor the costs of long-term care and adjust the portfolio accordingly. Consider home health care, assisted living, or nursing home options.\n",
      "*   **Coordinate with Healthcare Providers:** Communicate with the client's healthcare providers to understand the projected care needs and associated costs.\n",
      "*   **Medicaid Planning:**  Consult with an elder law attorney to explore Medicaid eligibility and potential strategies to protect assets.\n",
      "*   **Estate Planning Updates:**  Regularly review and update the estate plan to ensure it reflects the client's wishes and addresses any changes in circumstances.\n",
      "*   **Social Security and Veteran's Benefits:** Explore potential eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or veteran's benefits.\n",
      "*   **Bereavement Support:**  Provide the spouse with information and resources for bereavement support and financial planning after the client's passing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**VI. Ongoing Communication and Documentation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Frequent Communication:**  Maintain frequent and open communication with the spouse. Explain the portfolio strategy, performance, and any changes.\n",
      "*   **Detailed Records:** Keep detailed records of all transactions, decisions, and communication.\n",
      "*   **Third-Party Verification:**  Consider involving a trusted family member or friend to provide an additional layer of oversight and support.\n",
      "*   **Fiduciary Duty:**  Always act in the client's best interest and uphold your fiduciary duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "**VII.  Ethical Considerations (Emphasized):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Capacity:** Continuously assess the client's capacity to understand and make financial decisions. If capacity diminishes significantly, rely on the power of attorney held by the spouse.\n",
      "*   **Conflicts of Interest:**  Disclose any potential conflicts of interest.\n",
      "*   **Transparency:**  Be fully transparent with the spouse about all aspects of the portfolio management.\n",
      "*   **Confidentiality:**  Maintain the client's confidentiality, but be mindful of the need to communicate with the spouse for effective management.\n",
